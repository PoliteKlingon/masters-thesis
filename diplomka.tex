Why does the app solve the problem? What value does it bring?

\chapter{Offline-enabled mobile applications}
\section{Concept}
thick client app capable of managing its own state not relying on server
\section{Issues to be tackled}
\subsection{Offline data availability}
data have to be downloaded in advance, kept updated; security concerns
\subsection{Partial changes management}
BE and FE must cooperate on keeping the data up to date without bulk-downloading over and over
\subsection{Local data management}
local DB, need to essentially fake your own BE on FE - the client thickness
\subsection{Server synchronization}
synchronize data client->server, manage conflicts - describe strategies, options
\subsection{Offline authentication, authorization}
app usability strongly relies on the user remaining authenticated while offline

\chapter{Technical approaches}
\section{Frameworks}
list of FE approaches to take with their (dis)advantages
\subsection{React-Native}
\subsection{React PWA}
\subsection{Native approaches}
\subsubsection{Kotlin}
\subsubsection{Flutter}
\subsection{Others}
\section{Local data management}
approaches to tackle the local data management
\subsection{Local database}
fake database
\subsection{Request intercepting, processing}
fake server
\subsection{TBA?}
\section{Synchronization}
\subsection{Mitigation}
\subsection{Duplication}
\subsection{Atribute timestamping}
\subsection{Advanced synchronization management}
(approaches based on advanced methods like GIT etc)

\chapter{Implementation}
\section{Functional and non-functional requirements}
\section{Architecture, technology stack}
\section{Axios Interceptor}
\section{Local data management}
\section{Synchronization}
